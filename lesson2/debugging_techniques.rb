# 1) Line by line.
# It's important to be patient to read through each line for any bugs
# If you aren't naturally patient, you need to build this skill bc its the
# most important

# 2) Rubber Duck
# Rubber duck is basically speaking out line-by-line about your code,
# what it's supposed to do, to anyone, even inatimate objects (hence where
# the name rubber duck comes from)
# The point is to describe what the code is supposed to do and observing what
# it actually does, any incongruity between these two becomes apparent.

# 3) Walk away
# Sometimes taking a break, by taking a walk, jogging or taking a shower can
# help your unconcious mind to better understand a problem
# this method only works when you fully understand the problem though

# 4) Pry
# Pry can help you debug
# type in require "pry" at the beginning of your file
# and wherever we want to inspect we will put in binding.pry
# the binding.pry will stop the execution of the problem
# cool tip: if we have a loop or some other iterating structure, we can use
# ctrl + d to run the loop in pry
