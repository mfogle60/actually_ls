# What are bugs?
- Bugs are human errors in code

# What is debugging?
- Debugging is removing those errors from the code

# The 3 Steps for debugging..

1. Identify the problem, find where the problem is in your code
  - Whether it is in your stack trace, or error message
2. Understand the problem
  - Once we identified the line of code, or the piece of code that was giving
    us problems then we can focus on trying to understand the problem better.
      - This may mean trying to understand the problem in its surrounding context
3. Implement a solution
  - This is where you change the code in order to eliminate the bug that
    was causing the issue.
  - If you did the first two steps correctly then this step should be relatively
    easy.

# Types of errors
- The way that we approach our previous debugging steps will depend on the type
  of error we get.
- 1. Syntax errors
  - These are caused because of incorrect spelling, not writing keyword appropriately
  - These errors generally stop your code from running
- 2. Logical errors
  - Errors in the logic of our code
  - Code generally runs but produces unexpected results
  - These errors are the ones where you actually have to use your patience and
    put effort into finding the bug

# What is pry?
- Pry is a RubyGem
  - This means that in order to use it you need to download it.
- Pry is also a REPL
  - REPL stands for:
    - 'Read', 'Evaluate', 'Print', 'Loop'
  - This basically means that pry does this:
    - Takes user input
    - Evaluates the input
    - Returns the results to the user
    - Loops back to the start

# Using Pry
- Pry is very similar to irb, you can open it in your terminal and it will
  have the same function as irb, but it is much more powerful for for the
  following reason: we can change scope.
  - We do this with the cd command, which allows us to go in and out of objects
  - Here is an example..

  **Imagine we are in pry**
  pry(main)
  arr = [1, 2, 3]

  cd arr

  **Now we are in arr object**

  pry(#<Array>)

  # IMPORTANT: We can even check the methods available for us to use on array with the
    command ls

  # Also we can see more about a method with the show-doc(enter method) command.
    - For example we can do: show-doc map
      - show-doc will show us everything there is to know about map, including examples

  # Invoking pry at run time

  # Debugging w/ pry
  - Pry is great for bugs in loops/iterating logic.. since it allows us to
    interrupt the program on each iteration
