# this game wont be dealing w/ double-down/splits or things like that in the game.

# So in this game, there are two people playing against each other:
  - the player vs the dealer

# Each player starts off w/ 2 cards, player can see their own 2 cards,
  and can only see one of dealers cards

# The point of the game is to get to as close as 21 as possible w/o going over.

# The game will also revolve around a deck of 52 cards which will have the
  the following cards:
  - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (all taken at face value)
  - the queen, jack and king all have a value of 10
  - the ace can have a value of 1 or 11 depending on when its used

# In their move, the player can either stay or take another card ('hit')
  - remember tho if they ask for another card and they go over 21
    then they lose
  - the players move will be over when they stay or they bust
  - if the player busts, the game is over and the dealer won

# The player can asks to hit as many times as they want..

# After the players turn, its the dealers turn
  - the dealer must play according to a strict rule:
    - Hit until the total is at least 17
  - if dealer busts, player wins

# How to determine value of ace..(Remember that ace can be 1 or 11)
  - its value depends on each time a new card is drawn from the deck
  -


********************************************************************************
# note: ace is either the value of 1 or 11, the value of the card will be
        11 unless it brings the total value of the players cards over 21
        in this case the ace is worth 1.

Pseudocode for game
- Game starts w/:
    - deck of 52 cards
    - Player gets 2 cards
    - Dealer gets 2 cards but only shows one card to player
- Players turn first
  *Player will see what cards they get*
  - player can either hit or stay
    - couple things can happen if the player hits..they dont bust, or they bust
  - if player busts, then game over
- If player is under 21 and stays then it is dealers turn
- Dealer must follow a strict rule:
  - It can hit until its cards AT LEAST have a value of 17..
  - if dealer busts then it loses
- Game is over when someone busts

# Algo for determining how to initiate the game,
1. Create deck of 52 cards
   - check out mini algorithm for deck of cards
2. Then from the deck of cards give the player two cards, and dealer 2 cards
   - these cards must be random


# Mini algorithm for creating deck of cards
   - There are 4 suits, so every suit will have 13 cards
   - Tho the suits don't matter too much, we can still organize the cards like that
     - 13 clubs
     - 13 diamonds
     - 13 hearts
     - 13 spades
   - Create a collection for every suit, one for hearts..one for diamonds..
   - make those collections part of the deck's collection
